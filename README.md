Markets Research for Consumer Buying Behavior

Overview

This repository contains the full workflow and analysis of a consumer buying behavior research project. Data collection was conducted using Google Forms, after which the data was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using SQL.

This project aims to understand how consumers make purchasing decisions, what factors influence them, and what patterns exist across different demographics.

Project Structure

/data/ – Raw and cleaned survey data exported from Google Forms and SQL.

/sql/ – SQL scripts for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the dataset.

/notebooks/ – Optional notebooks for extended insights and visualization.

/docs/ – Documentation, summaries, and interpretations.


Data Collection

Data was collected using Google Forms.

Responses were exported to CSV format.

The CSV was imported into a SQL database for cleaning and analysis.


Tools & Technologies

Google Forms – Primary data collection tool.

MySQL – Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard development.

Git/GitHub – Version control and documentation.


Visualization

The cleaned and transformed dataset was exported into Power BI, where interactive dashboards and visuals were created to highlight key trends in consumer buying behavior.
